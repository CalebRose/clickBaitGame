12th Assignment - Clicky Game as part of the UT Austin Coding Bootcamp

## Purpose

The game at its core is a memory game. To begin, users can click on any Character Card. Upon clicking a card, the user's score goes up by 1, and the layout of cards changes randomly. The goal of the user is to click on as many unique cards as possible. If the user has clicked on a Character Card that they've previously clicked, the user's score is reset to 0. The Top score will be recorded, and users will be able to challenge theirselves to beat their top score.

### React Features Used
This assignment takes advantage of the following features in React:
 - Class-based components
 - Event listeners
 - Conditional Rendering
 - Props
 - Set State Rendering
 
 ## Personal Thoughts on Assignment
 React was one of my favorite things to learn in the UT Coding Bootcamp. I will admit that once we started to learn React in class that the way it worked was entirely different from vanilla JS and jQuery. Once my classmates and I got to practicing React outside of class and working on this assignment, we found the challenges from this assignment to be worthwhile and relevant to the basic features that React provides.
